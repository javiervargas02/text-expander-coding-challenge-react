## Project description

This project is built using create-react-app. My goal for this project is to practice React concepts such as useState, props, one-way data flow, the array .map and .filter functions. While also taking into account React's best practices.

The project is a simple travel checklist that lets the user add items and their respective quantity to the check list, also, the user can filter by oldest items first, alphabetical order or by packed status, the last one meaning if the item has been marked as packed. Also, the user can visualize progress in the bottom section, by letting the user know how many items are on the checklist, how many have the user packed and what percentage of the items have been packed.

The project does not focus too much on a responsive design but instead focuses on putting into practice important and useful React concepts. So, it is best to view the project on a laptop or a desktop computer.
